# Adjust Screen Temperature

This [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) script uses the little CLI program
[ddcset](https://github.com/arcnmx/ddcset-rs) by [arcnmx](https://github.com/arcnmx)
to adjust the color temperature of the screen using only the color settings of the actual hardware.

This method is more limited than software solutions, but it's also more reliable and has zero performance impact.

## Install

Install AutoHotkey.  
Put the `ddcset` exe somewhere in you `PATH`.

## Usage

Run the script.  
Use Win + Alt + PageUp/PageDown to increase or decrease you screen color temperature.
